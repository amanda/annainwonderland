anna karenina in wonderland: takes people entities from one text and swaps them with the people in another.

## usage

run the script and it will prompt you for the names of people to insert, or (optional) run using a list of people in a text file separated by newlines:

```py
python annainwonderland.py sourcetextfile [-l listfile]```

a file called 'sourcetextfile-swapped.txt' will appear in the current directory with your new people inserted.
